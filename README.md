# Reverse Proxy 
This repository is the glue holding together many of my other repositories in the subdomains of my portfolio website [pajordan.com](https://pajordan.com).
## Why?
I took this approach to organizing my web-based projects, portfolios and showcases (all on one server from multiple subdomains) because it will help test my skills in linux systems eadministration, give me an easy way to deploy new ideas, but mostly because it's relatively cheap compared to testing out new web stacks and plug-and-play services on completely new servers.
I know this particular repository isn't very impressive, but as time goes on I hope to integrate more interesting tools and metrics and in the process learn more about linux and web hosting.
